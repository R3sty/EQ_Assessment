          <Typography variant="body1">
            This assessment is a forced-choice psychological assessment that
            requires you to choose the statement that describes you best. For
            each question, select the statement that best applies to you. Do not
            over-analyze the questions or try to think of "exceptions to the
            rule." Be spontaneous and choose the statement that comes closest to
            the way you usually are. Occasionally, there will be questions that
            ask you to make a close call or require you to respond to situations
            that you have little experience with. This is because the questions
            are designed to distinguish between specific areas of emotional
            intelligence. If a question is very close and you canâ€™t decide which
            statement applies to you best, just choose the answer that seems
            best. If you want, you can come back to it after you have completed
            the other questions. But we recommend that you quickly choose the
            best answer and move on.

            The evaluation has 50 questions and usually takes about 10 minutes
            to complete. At the end of the assessment, click on the Score
            Assessment button, and wait for your overall results. Don't try to
            game the assessment. That will not help you to understand your
            emotional intelligence, and your assessment is private anyways. We
            do not share this data with anyone, and never will. This assessment
            has been calibrated through many trials and verification interviews
            to ensure it is as accurate as possible. Therefore, your personal
            assessment should be accurate, provided that you have answered
            honestly and accurately.
