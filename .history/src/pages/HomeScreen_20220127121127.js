            This assessment is a forced-choice psychological assessment that
            requires you to choose the statement that describes you best.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            This assessment has been calibrated through many trials and
            verification interviews to ensure it is as accurate as possible.
            Therefore, your personal assessment should be accurate, provided
            that you have answered honestly and accurately.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            At the end of the assessment, click on the Score Assessment button,
