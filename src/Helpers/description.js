While you may have some areas where you display high emotional intelligence, there are times or situations where you find it difficult to keep your emotions in check. There may be times when you find it difficult to understand the motivations of colleagues and you struggle to provide motivation to direct reports as they work to achieve their tasks. You would benefit by considering the events and situations that trigger you and those around you, then come up with more supportive responses. A key point to remember as you develop your emotional intelligence is, as you work on one area, you are building your skills in all areas. ",
